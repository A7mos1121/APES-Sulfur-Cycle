                    <li> <h3> Volatilization: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> It is the conversion of a liquid chemical into a vapor, which escapes into the atmosphere. </li> </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Organic Sulfur: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> Organic Sulfur compounds are volatile. </li> 
                    <li> Some of them are a few soluble in water and are associated with bad odor. In aqueos solution [29], they present a characterstic <abbr title="UltraViolet"> UV </abbr> absorption </li> 
                    <li> They are essentially studied in gaseous phase, but they can be present in wastewater because of their solubility in water-miscrible solvents such as alcohols. </li> </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Mineralization & Immobilization: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> The microbal conversion of organic sulfur in the form of humans and crop residues to <abbr title="SO4"> sulfate </abbr>, termed mineralization, is a dominant mechanism for replenishment of available sulfur.</li> </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Oxidation: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> Microbal oxidation of <strong> sulfur </strong> is the oxidation of <strong> sulfur </strong> by microorganisms to build their structural components.
                    </li> 
                    <li> The oxidation of inorganic compounds is the strategy primarily used by <abbr title="Rock Eaters Bacteria"> chemolithotroph </abbr> microorganisms to obtain energy to survive, grow and reproduce.</li> </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Reduction: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> Bacteria like Desulfuromonas acetoxidans are capable of reducing <strong> sulfur </strong> at the expense of <abbr title="C2H3O2"> acetate </abbr>.</li> 
                    <li> Some iron-reducing bacteria are also capable of reducing <strong> sulfur </strong>. Many of these bacteria are able to generate <abbr title="Adenosine TriPhosphate"> ATP </abbr> during sulfur reduction </li> </ul>
