                Sulfur is mainly found within sedimentary rocks and the ocean. Sulfur can be released through rocks by weathering, or through the air during industrial processes. While in the atmosphere sulfur can do many things. Sulfur can combine with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO2). It can also react with water vapor in the atmosphere  to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4) which can drop down to earth as acid rain. Acid rain has the capability to dissolve things containing sulfur minerals in the soil that can release sulfur ions into the water.In the soil sulfur can go through mineralization, where organic forms of sulfur convert into inorganic forms, or remain in the soil as sulfates. Plants can absorb the sulfur in the soil through their roots and incorporate the sulfur into their tissues. Animals may obtain sulfur by consuming the plants or other animals. When the plants or animals die or produce waste, sulfur is returned into the soil. Decomposers such as bacteria break down the organic matter, releasing the sulfur compounds back into the environment. The sulfur cycle can occur within water systems when bacteria converts sulfur into hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This hydrogen sulfide can evaporate out of the ocean into the atmosphere, or be absorbed by marine algaes, who produce dimethyl sulfide, which can then be released into the atmosphere and converted into sulfur dioxide. The sulfur cycle is continuously occurring as sulfur is constantly being used and reprocessed through nature.

                    <li> <h3> Volatilization: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> It is the conversion of a liquid chemical into a vapor, which escapes into the atmosphere.</li> </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Organic Sulfur: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Organic Sulfur compounds are volatile. </li> 
                        <li> Some of them are a few soluble in water and are associated with bad odor. In aqueous solution, they present a characterstic <abbr title="UltraViolet"> UV </abbr> absorption.</li> 
                        <li> They are essentially studied in gaseous phase, but they can be present in wastewater because of their solubility in water-miscrible solvents such as alcohols. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Mineralization & Immobilization: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> The microbal conversion of organic sulfur in the form of humans and crop residues to <abbr title="SO4"> sulfate</abbr>, termed mineralization, is a dominant mechanism for replenishment of available sulfur.</li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Oxidation: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Microbal oxidation of <strong> sulfur </strong> is the oxidation of <strong> sulfur </strong> by microorganisms to build their structural components.
                        </li> 
                        <li> The oxidation of inorganic compounds is the strategy primarily used by <abbr title="Rock Eaters Bacteria"> chemolithotroph </abbr> microorganisms to obtain energy to survive, grow and reproduce.</li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Reduction: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Bacteria like Desulfuromonas acetoxidans are capable of reducing <strong> sulfur </strong> at the expense of <abbr title="C2H3O2"> acetate </abbr>.</li> 
                        <li> Some iron-reducing bacteria are also capable of reducing <strong> sulfur </strong>. Many of these bacteria are able to generate <abbr title="Adenosine TriPhosphate"> ATP</abbr> during sulfur reduction </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Leaching: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Like <abbr title="NO3"> Nitrate</abbr>, sulfate is a negatively charged ion (anion). Since soils typically carry a new negative charge, sulfate does not adhere to soil particles like positively charged ions (cations) like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Due to this negative charge, both nitrate and sulfate are susceptible to leaching. But to what degree?</li> 
                        <li> Most soil scientists think that sulfate has slightly less leaching potential than nitrate. This is mostly due to larger molecular mass and nearly constant cycling by bacteria in soils with organic matter at or above 3%. However, leaching potential is still high, which should drive decisions regarding the best sulfur fertilizer choice and application timing. It is estimated that only 10-15% of sulfur present in soils is in the sulfate form, while the remainder is in organic form.  </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Dissolution: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Sulfur dissolves primarily into water, but can also be dissolved in a variety of substances, like carbon disulfide, benzene, toluene, and some other nonpolar organic solvents. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Absorbtion into Soil: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Sulfur-containing compounds are commonly used in agriculture to lower soil pH and thus make them more acidic. Sulfur is supplied to the plant in the sulfate (SO42-) form, taken in by the roots via soil solution. </li> 
                        <li> Sometimes sulfur dioxide (SO2) is taken in from the surrounding air through leaf stomata. However, the quantity taken up in its gaseous form is limited.</li> 
                        <li> Sulfur has a critical role in amino acid formation. Combined with nitrogen, sulfur forms many amino acid chains, which are the building blocks of proteins. Sulfur is also critical in the process of photosynthesis. Since photosynthesis is a crucial process where a plant synthesizes its own food, ensuring sufficient sulfur is present is critical.</li> 
                        <li> Sulfur is an essential nutrient in the biological nitrogen fixation process carried out by bacteria in relationship with plants and soil. This is why leguminous crops will need more sulfur compared to other crops. Finally, sulfur is an important part of the production of the pungent oils found in crops like garlic. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Acid Rain: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.  These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground.</li> 
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    Human activities play a large role in the acceleration of processes in the sulfur cycle. When large quantities of fossil fuels, such as coal, are burned, more hydrogen sulfide gas is released into the air. This increase in hydrogen sulfide gas creates acid rain. Acid rain is incredibly corrosive, as it falls to the ground as sulfuric acid. This sulfuric acid can lower the pH of lakes, making them more acidic, which can harm the wildlife that live in them, and can corrode things such as marble, causing damage to many monuments or statues. Humans also refine and convert sulfur to become different types of resources, such as refining sulfur that contains petroleum into gasoline, or converting sulfur containing ores into metals such as copper, increasing the amount of sulfur that is within our environment.

                    The largest physical reservoir of sulfur is located within the Earth's crust. This sulfur is released through volcanic eruptions. The ocean is also a large reservoir of sulfur, with large quantities in the form of dissolved sulfate and sedimentary minerals, where sulfur can be in organic or inorganic forms. Another sulfur reservoir is the soil, where sulfur exists in inorganic and organic forms. The inorganic forms of sulfur are uptaken by plants through their roots, while the organic forms of sulfur are found as microbial biomass within soil.
