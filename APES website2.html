                <ol>
                    <li> <h3> Volatilization: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> <li> It is the conversion of a liquid chemical into a vapor, which escapes into the atmosphere.</li> </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Organic Sulfur: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Organic Sulfur compounds are volatile. </li> 
                        <li> Some of them are a few soluble in water and are associated with bad odor. In aqueos solution [29], they present a characterstic <abbr title="UltraViolet"> UV </abbr> absorption.</li> 
                        <li> They are essentially studied in gaseous phase, but they can be present in wastewater because of their solubility in water-miscrible solvents such as alcohols. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Mineralization & Immobilization: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> The microbal conversion of organic sulfur in the form of humans and crop residues to <abbr title="SO4"> sulfate</abbr>, termed mineralization, is a dominant mechanism for replenishment of available sulfur.</li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Oxidation: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Microbal oxidation of <strong> sulfur </strong> is the oxidation of <strong> sulfur </strong> by microorganisms to build their structural components.
                        </li> 
                        <li> The oxidation of inorganic compounds is the strategy primarily used by <abbr title="Rock Eaters Bacteria"> chemolithotroph </abbr> microorganisms to obtain energy to survive, grow and reproduce.</li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Reduction: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Bacteria like Desulfuromonas acetoxidans are capable of reducing <strong> sulfur </strong> at the expense of <abbr title="C2H3O2"> acetate </abbr>.</li> 
                        <li> Some iron-reducing bacteria are also capable of reducing <strong> sulfur </strong>. Many of these bacteria are able to generate <abbr title="Adenosine TriPhosphate"> ATP</abbr> during sulfur reduction </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Leaching: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Like <abbr title="NO3"> Nitrate</abbr>, sulfate is a negatively charged ion (anion). Since soils typically carry a new negative charge, sulfate does not adhere to soil particles like positively charged ions (cations) like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Due to this negative charge, both nitrate and sulfate are susceptible to leaching. But to what degree?</li> 
                        <li> Most soil scientists think that sulfate has slightly less leaching potential than nitrate. This is mostly due to larger molecular mass and nearly constant cycling by bacteria in soils with organic matter at or above 3%. However, leaching potential is still high, which should drive decisions regarding the best sulfur fertilizer choice and application timing. It is estimated that only 10-15% of sulfur present in soils is in the sulfate form, while the remainder is in organic form.  </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Dissolution: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Sulfur dissolves primarily into water, but can also be dissolved in a variety of substances, like carbon disulfide, benzene, toluene, and some other nonpolar organic solvents. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Absorbtion into Soil: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Sulfur-containing compounds are commonly used in agriculture to lower soil pH and thus make them more acidic. Sulfur is supplied to the plant in the sulfate (SO42-) form, taken in by the roots via soil solution. </li> 
                        <li> Sometimes sulfur dioxide (SO2) is taken in from the surrounding air through leaf stomata. However, the quantity taken up in its gaseous form is limited.</li> 
                        <li> Sulfur has a critical role in amino acid formation. Combined with nitrogen, sulfur forms many amino acid chains, which are the building blocks of proteins. Sulfur is also critical in the process of photosynthesis. Since photosynthesis is a crucial process where a plant synthesizes its own food, ensuring sufficient sulfur is present is critical.</li> 
                        <li> Sulfur is an essential nutrient in the biological nitrogen fixation process carried out by bacteria in relationship with plants and soil. This is why leguminous crops will need more sulfur compared to other crops. Finally, sulfur is an important part of the production of the pungent oils found in crops like garlic. </li> 
                    </ul>

                    <li> <h3> Acid Rain: </h3> </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.  These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground.</li> 
                    </ul>
